## 📖 Overview  
Sign languages are powerful modes of communication for the deaf and hard-of-hearing communities. Our project, **Advanced Sign Language Recognition**, aims to bridge communication gaps by leveraging **deep learning** to recognize and interpret **Indian Sign Language (ISL)** gestures.  

Through cutting-edge machine learning models, we focus on providing an accessible, efficient, and robust solution for ISL recognition that could pave the way for inclusive communication.
